this script generates randomized super mario bros level-like images.

how to run:

    ./markovio.py

original map obtained from http://ian-albert.com/misc/smb.php and scaled/
modified to a representational format where one pixel equals one tile, or 16x16
pixels in-game, and each color represents a certain type of tile:

    brown = brick/ground
    blue = question box
    white = cloud
    red = spring
    grey = pipe
    light blue = sky

the level is 5-2 by the way.  i haven't yet figured out a good way to automate
the "cleaning up" of input maps, so i haven't tried it with other levels.
tree/water/castle levels could be interesting.
